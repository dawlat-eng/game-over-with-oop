A web application that showcases a variety of free-to-play games, all powered by a dynamic API! ðŸŒŸ
OOP Structure:
I utilized Object-Oriented Programming principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase. Classes like Games, UiHome, and GameDetails handle different aspects of the application, promoting clean code practices.
API Integration: The application fetches real-time data from the free-to-play games database, allowing users to explore games by category, view details, and access links directly.
Responsive Design: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is designed to provide a seamless experience across all devices.
